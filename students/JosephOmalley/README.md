Hello! My name is Joseph O'Malley, I'm 28 years old and I was born and raised in Seattle, WA. I attended the Evergreen State College followed by Western Washington University where I received a degree in Philosopy. I've worked as a house painter, pizza maker, bicycle messenger, art gallery attendant, art mover and installer, A/V technician and bartender/barista. 

##Interests

I enjoy making music and play in a metal band. I try to go running and ride my bike as much as possible. I find cats hilarious and live with two (Turkey and Menthie). I own a shitty motorcycle that I use for commuting. Some of my favorite authors are : Thomas Mann, Nabokov, Dostoyevsky annndddd ok lets be honest, I can barely remember anything I've read.
