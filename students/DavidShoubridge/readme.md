###About Me:

I graduated from Central Washington University in 2013 with a degree in Business Administration, and have since worked for a construction company as a project assistant and a freight forwarding firm as a move coordinator. I have always loved computers; I remember how excited my brothers and I were when our family acquired it's first desktop PC in the mid 1990's. Even though it was for my father to work on, we quickly found ways to play games on it when he didn't need it, and eventually we all ended up with our own custom built (alright they weren't that fancy, at all, but we still built them!) gaming machines.

Even though I've spent most of my life around technology, it hasn't been until recently that I became interested in programming. I've always enjoyed technology, so I decided to branch out and try to teach myself something new. A friend recommeneded I check out CodeFellows, so I went through the Foundations 1 course and really enjoyed it; and that brings me here, to Foundations 2: Python.
