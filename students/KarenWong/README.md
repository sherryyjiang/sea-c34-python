## About Me
 Hi! This is Karen and I am originally from Hong Kong, China. I got my BA in Political Science and Japanese at UW. After graduation, I worked for a small Biotech company for a year then went back to Hong Kong for law school. I am taking a year off from my studies now to learn programming in the hope that I can gain some technical/hard skills that can help me advance my career.

## Random fact I want to share
 I like to watch cooking videos in my spare time. Here's one of my favorite. [Cooking with the Dog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_XofYYxrLYw)
