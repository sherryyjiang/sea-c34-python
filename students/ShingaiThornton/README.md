##Bio

I'm originally from the San Francisco bay area and received a B.A. in the Social Sciences from USC in 2012. I've been a technology enthusiast since I first got my hands on a computer around the age of 5, and I've taken a couple of introductory Python classes online through Coursera.

I'm a passionate believer in the potential for new technology to transform society for the better, and enjoy researching and experimenting with disruptive technologies in my free time. My main career goal is to land a position as growth hacker for one of my favorite open-source projects, both of which feature Python in their stack. [Storj](http://storj.io/): a decentralized cloud storage platform (a peer-to-peer version of Dropbox) and [Augur](http://www.augur.net/): a decentralized prediction market (a market where you bet on the outcome of future events.)
