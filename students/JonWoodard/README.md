Here is a brief intorduction to me!
===================================
  1. I grew up in Tacoma.
  2. I have a BS in Biochemistry for the UW.
  3. I have been laid off from two biotech companies in the last five years.
  4. In the course of my work, I have often found that the software that I wanted for a particular project did not exist, so I thought that I had better learn to create it.
